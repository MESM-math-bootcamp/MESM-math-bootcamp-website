    "text": "Derivative Rules\n\nExplain how to find the derivative of the following functions. Be sure to explicitly denote which derivative rules (constant, multiple, sum, product, chain, etc.) you would use. For extra practice, have a try at solving them!\n\n\n\\(\\large f(x)=\\sqrt{(x+3)}\\)\n\n We can use chain rule to compute this one, with the outer function being \\(\\sqrt(u)\\) and ithe inner function being \\(x+3\\). We can compute each of these derivatives using the power rule. We obtain that&lt;&gt;\n \\[\nf'(x)=\\frac{1}{2\\sqrt{(x+3)}}\n\\] \n\n\\(h(a)=\\frac{\\exp^{-a}}{a^2-5}\\)\n\n First we would use the quotient rule then to solve for the individual derivatives. The individual derivatives will require us to use the chain rule (for the numerator) and the power rule (for the denominator). We obtain that \n \\[\nh'(a)=\\frac{-(a^2-5)e^{-a}-(2a)e^{-a}}{(a^2-5)^2}\n\\] \n\n\\(g(t)=\\left(\\frac{5t^3+2}{2(t^2-2)}\\right)^6\\)\n\n First chain rule. In the \\(u\\)-substitution we have to use the quotient and power rules. \n \\[\\begin{align}\ng(t)&=\\left(\\frac{5t^3+2}{2(t^2-2)}\\right)^6 \\\\\ng(t)&=u(t)^6  &u=\\frac{5t^3+2}{2(t^2-2)}\\\\\ng'(t)&=6(u(t))^5\\times u'(t)  &\\frac{du}{dt}=\\frac{2(t^2-2)15t^2-4t(5t^3+2)}{(2(t^2-2))^2} \\\\\ng'(t)&=6(u(t))^5* \\frac{2(t^2-2)15t^2-4t(5t^3+2)}{(2(t^2-2))^2} \\\\\ng'(t)&=6\\left(\\frac{5t^3+2}{2(t^2-2)}\\right)^5\\frac{2(t^2-2)15t^2-4t(5t^3+2)}{(2(t^2-2))^2}\n\\end{align}\\] \n\nOn the graph, label all regions where the following statements are true:\n\n\n\\(f'(x)=0\\)\n\n We have that \\('f(x)=0\\) at \\(x=-2\\) and \\(x=2\\), these are a minima and maxima respectively. \n\n\\(f'(x)&gt;0\\) \nThe function \\(f(x)\\) has a positive derivative whenever it is increasing, this happens over the interval (-2,0). This is indicated as the blue interval on the graph below. \n\\(f'(x)&lt;0\\)\n\n The function \\(f(x)\\) has a negative derivative whenever it is decreasing, this happens over the intervals \\((-\\infty,-2)\\) and \\((0,\\infty)\\). This range is indicated by the red intervals on the graph below. \nd)\\(f''(x)&gt;0\\)\n\nThe second derivative \\(f''(x)\\) is positive whenever the function is concave up (it has a U shape). The points at which the graph changes concavity are called inflection points. We can estimate the function is concave up whenever \\(x&lt;-1\\). \n\n\\(f''(x)&lt;0\\)\n\n The second derivative \\(f''(x)\\) is negative whenever the function is concave down (it has an upside-down U shape). The points at which the graph changes concavity are called inflection points. We can estimate the function is concave down whenever \\(x&gt;-1\\). \n\n\n\n\n\nThe color bars correspond to the verbal statements and their colors in answer key above\n\n\n\n\n\nFind the derivative of these equations\n\n\n\\(f(x)=e^{x^2+3}\\)\n\n \\[\nf'(x)=2x e^{x^2+3}\n\\] \n\n\\(f(x)=\\sqrt(2x)(x^3-4x+15)\\)\n\n \\[\nf'(x) =\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2x}}(x^3-4x+15)+\\sqrt{2x}(3x^2-4)\n\\] \n\n\\(f(x)=\\frac{x^3+2x}{x-1}\\)\n\n \\[\nf'(x)=\\frac{(x-1)(3x^2+2)-(x^3+2x)(1)}{(x-1)^2}\n\\] \n\nFind the critical points of the following function and determine whether they are maxima or minima:\n\n\\[\nf(x) = 2x^3-5x^2+3x-12.\n\\]\n To do this we neeed to first find the critical points by solving \\(f'(x)=0\\) and then use the second derivative test on the critical points we find to determine if they are a maxima or a minima. Computing the first derivative using the power rule we have that \n \\[\nf'(x)=6x^2-10x+3=0\n\\] \n Then, using the quadratic formula to solve this equation we get that the critical points of \\(f(x)\\) are \\(x\\approx 1.27\\) and \\(x\\approx 0.39\\). \n Next, the second derivative is \\(f''(x)=12x-10\\), and evaluating this at the critical points we get that \\[f''(1.27)&gt;0 \\ \\text{ and } \\ f''(0.39)&lt;0\\] \n Therefore, based on the first and second order conditions, there are two optimas for this function at \\(x\\approx 1.27\\) and \\(x\\approx 0.39\\). Plugging these values into the second order derivative we can see that \\(x\\approx 0.39\\) is a maximum and \\(x\\approx 1.27\\) is a minimum. \n\n\n\nLet’s solve the canonical Gordon-Schaefer fisheries production model. This model formed the basis of fisheries management for half a century and is still a widely used model. It starts by defining the change in the abundance or biomass of fish by the logistic growth equation:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{dB}{dt}=rB(t)(1-\\frac{B(t)}{K})\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(B\\) is biomass, \\(t\\) is time, \\(r\\) is the intrinsic growth rate, and \\(K\\) is the carrying capacity.\nNext, fishers catch fish based on their effort \\(E\\) (constant), technological ability \\(q\\) (constant as well and also called the catchability coefficient), and the amount of fish \\(B\\). For simplicity, we use an easy multiplicative form:\n\\[\nY(t)=qEB(t)\n\\]\nThis catch rate takes away from the growth of the fish stock, thus we can subtract it from the logistic growth equation 1.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{dB}{dt}=rB(t)(1-\\frac{B(t)}{K})-Y(t)\n\\end{equation}\\]\na) Fishery managers are interested in finding the equilibrium level of biomass and harvest. We can set \\(\\frac{dB}{dt}=0\\). Solve for the equilibrium biomass in terms of K,q,r,E.\n Substituting \\(Y(t)\\) in \\(\\frac{dB}{dt}\\) and solving for B we obtain: \\[\n\\begin{align}\n0&=rB(1-\\frac{B}{K})-qEB \\\\\nqEB&=rB(1-\\frac{B}{K})\\\\\nqE&=r(1-\\frac{B}{K})\\\\\n\\frac{rB}{K}&=r-qE \\\\\nB&=K(1-\\frac{qE}{r}).\n\\end{align}\n\\] \nb) Substitute the equilibrium biomass you found in (a) into the catch equation.\n Making this substitution we obtain \\[\n\\begin{align}\nY&=qEB \\\\\n&=qEK(1-\\frac{qE}{r})\\\\\n&=qEK-\\frac{q^2E^2K}{r}.\n\\end{align}\n\\] \nc) What effort leads to a maximum sustainable yield? Maximize the equation from b) with respect to effort \\(E\\).\n Let’s take the derivative of the previous equation with respet to \\(E\\): \\[\n\\begin{align}\n\\frac{dY}{dE}&= \\frac{d}{dE} qEK-\\frac{q^2E^2K}{r}\\\\\n   &= qK-\\frac{2q^2EK}{r}.\n\\end{align}\n\\] \n To find the effort \\(E\\) that leads to the maximum yield we find the critical points: \\[\n\\begin{align}\nqK-\\frac{2q^2EK}{r} = 0 &\\Rightarrow qK =\\frac{2q^2EK}{r} \\\\\n                        &\\Rightarrow  E^* = \\frac{r}{2q}.\n\\end{align}\n\\] \nd) Interpret what you found in c). What are the two variables that drive fisher harvest levels?\n The amount of effort that leads to the most amount of catch is driven entirely by the rate of growth of fish stocks and the ability of fishers to catch them. If \\(q\\) catchability goes up, fishers become more efficient and need less effort to reach max harvest. Faster growing species allow for more growth and thus more effort to catch them. \ne) Calculate what is the maximum sustainable yield by substituting the optimal harvest level into the harvest equation.\n Doing this substitution we obtain that the maximum sustainable yield is \\[\\begin{align}\nY_{\\text{max}}=\\frac{qrK}{2q}-\\frac{q^2(\\frac{r}{2q})^2K}{r}\\\\\nY_{\\text{max}}=\\frac{rK}{2}-\\frac{rK}{4}\\\\\nY_{\\text{max}}=\\frac{Kr}{4}.\n\\end{align}\\]"

So let’s do that:\n\\[x'(2024) = \\beta(c-\\beta 2024)^{-2} = 13,980.\\]\nSo, human population in 2024 will be increasing at a rate of 13,980 million per year according to this model."

A new RCP projection indicates that carbon concentrations in the atmosphere will plateau at around 600 ppm. Today’s atmospheric carbon concentration sits at 416 ppm.\n\nIf the United States continues to emit proportionally the same amount of carbon (14%), how much carbon will the US emit in 2100 under RCP 4.5?

    "text": "Limits and Derivatives Problem Set Solutions\nAnswer the following questions to the best of your ability. Attempt exercises on your own first to make sure you fully understand the concepts. Feel free to work with anyone in the cohort after giving the problems a try!\n\nWhich of these graphs depict functions and which do not?\n\n Graphs A,B, and C all fail the vertical line test. Thus they are not functions. Graph D is a function because passes the vertical line test and thus is a function. \n\nInvestigate what is the value of the following limits:\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x\\to -2^-}\\frac{4x}{x+2}\n\\]\nTo investigate this limit we can evaluate the function \\(\\frac{4x}{x+2}\\) from the left with values getting closer to -2. We can see from the approximation below that \\(y = \\frac{4x}{x+2}\\) rapidly increases with values closer to -2. So, we can say the limit goes to infinity. \n\n\n\n\n\nx\n-2.5\n-2.1\n-2.01\n-2.001\n-2.0001\n-2.00001\n\n\ny\n20.0\n84.0\n804.00\n8004.000\n80004.0000\n800003.99999\n\n\n\n\n\n We can also plot the function to have a visual understanding of its behavior near -2. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x\\to 3}2^x\n\\]\n To investigate this limit we can evaluate the function \\(2^x\\) with values of \\(x\\) approaching 3 from the left and the right. The table below shows that the limit approaches 8 at x=3 from both directions, so we can say \\(\\lim_{x\\to 3}2^x=8\\). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nx\n2.500000\n2.900000\n2.99000\n2.999000\n3.001000\n3.010000\n3.100000\n3.50000\n\n\ny\n5.656854\n7.464264\n7.94474\n7.994457\n8.005547\n8.055644\n8.574188\n11.31371\n\n\n\n\n\n We can also graph this function and see it is continuous. So \\(\\lim_{x\\to 3}2^x = 2^3 = 8\\). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDetermine the value of \\(b\\) to make \\(h(x)\\) continuous at \\(x=-3\\). Explain your reasoning using limits.\n\n\\[\nh(x)=\\begin{cases}\nbx^2-\\frac{3}{2}x-5 &x&lt;-3 \\\\\n-2x-9 &x\\ge-3\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nThis function is broken down into two “pieces”: it equals \\(bx^2 - \\frac{3}{2}x - 5\\) when \\(x\\) is less than -3, and it equals \\(-2x-9\\) when \\(x\\) is greater or equal to -3. To connect these two pieces and make \\(h(x)\\) continuous we need both pieces to approach the same value at \\(x=-3\\). In other words, we need that \n \\[ -3 = h(x) = \\lim_{x\\to-3} h(x).\\] \n Let’s calculate the side limits to see what’s going on with \\(\\lim_{x\\to-3} h(x)\\). From the left-hand side we have that \nxw \\[\\lim_{x\\to-3^-} h(x) = \\lim_{x\\to-3^-} bx^2 - \\frac{3}{2}x - 5 = 9b + \\frac{9}{2}.\\] \na8670390NCEAS\nFrom the right-hand side we have that \n \\[\n\\lim_{x\\to-3^+} h(x) = \\lim_{x\\to-3^+} -2x-9 = -3\n\\] \n If we want \\(h(x)\\) to be continuous at \\(x=-3\\) we then need \n \\[ -3 = h(x) = \\lim_{x\\to-3^-} h(x) = \\lim_{x\\to-3^+} h(x) =  9b + \\frac{9}{2} \\] \n Solving this equation we obtain that \n \\[\n\\begin{align}\n9b=\\frac{-5}{2}\\\\\nb=\\frac{-5}{18}.\n\\end{align}\n\\] \n\nLet \\(f(x) = 2x^2+4\\). Calculate \\(f'(x)\\) and \\(f'(-3)\\).\n\n \\[\\begin{align}\nf(x)  &= 2x^2+4\\\\\nf'(x) &= 4x\\\\\nf'(-3) &=4(-3)\\\\\n      &=-12\n\\end{align}\\] \n\nCalculate the derivative of \\(g(x) = x^4-5x^3+x-5\\) at \\(x=5\\).\n\n \\[\\begin{align}\ng(x) &= x^4-5x^3+x-5 \\\\\ng'(x) &= 4x^3-15x^2+1 \\\\\ng'(5) &= 4(5)^3-15(5)^2+1\\\\\n&=126\n\\end{align}\\] \n\nWhat is the instantaneous rate of change of \\(h(x) = \\frac{5}{x^2}\\) at \\(x=2\\)?\n\n We have that \n \\[\nh(x) = \\frac{5}{x^2} = 5x^{-2}\n\\] \n Then, \n \\[\\begin{align}\nh'(x) & =-10x^{-3}\\\\\nh'(2) &= -10(2)^{-3}\\\\\n& = -\\frac{10}{8}\\\\\n&=-1.25.\n\\end{align}\\] \n\n\n\n\nApproximate the slope of the tangent line in the graph below at \\(x=2\\).\nWrite a short paragraph describing how the slope of the tangent line represents the derivative.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n a. First, we draw a tangent line to the graph at \\(x=2\\), this is the red line plotted with the graph.\nUsing rise over run we can take two points on the tangent line to find the slope. Let’s use \\((2,1)\\) and \\((1,-1)\\) as our points on the tangent, then \n \\[\nslope=\\frac{1- (-1)}{2-1}=2.\n\\] \n b. The tangent line provides the slope or instaneous rate of change at single point along the curve. Therefore the slope of the tangent line is the derivative."

A new RCP projection indicates that carbon concentrations in the atmosphere will plateau at around 600 ppm. Today’s atmospheric carbon concentration sits at 416 ppm.\n\nIf the United States continues to emit proportionally the same amount of carbon (14%), how much carbon will the US emit in 2100 under RCP 4.5? Use the conversion 1 ppm=2.13 gigaton to give your answer in gigatons.\n\n\n Since the fraction of US carbon emissions will remain constant at 14% we can calculate that the US will emit 14% of the 600 ppm in 2100: \n \\[\n\\begin{align}\n600 * 0.14 &=& 84 \\text{ ppm}\\\\\n  &=& 84* 2.13 \\text{ gigaton}\\\\\n  &=& 178.92 \\text{ gigaton}\n\\end{align}\n\\] \n\nLet’s say the US decides to pursue an ambitious policy to extract their contribution of carbon from the air. Climatologists model that this policy would have a trajectory of \\(f(t)=\\frac{-1}{8}t^2+6t+123.83\\) where \\(t\\) is each year and \\(f(t)\\) is the amount of carbon released by the US. When will the United States eliminate their carbon footprint?\n\nBased on the model of the scientists, we need to where the total amount of US carbon equals 0. In other words, we need to find when \\[f(t) = \\frac{1}{8}t^2+6t+123.83=0.\\]\n\n Because \\(f(t)\\) is a second degree polynomial we can use the quadratic equation to find it’s roots: \n \\[\n\\begin{align}\nt &=& \\frac{-6\\pm\\sqrt{6^2-4(\\frac{-1}{8}*123.83)}}{\\frac{-2}{8}} \\\\\nt &\\approx& 63.581 \\text{ years}\n\\end{align}\n\\] \nWe are only concerned about the postive year amounts.\n\n\nGraphs\n\nFind the slope and \\(y\\)-intercept of the following lines.\n\n\n\nShow the code\nx=seq(-5,5)\n\ny=2*x+5\n\nw=(1/3)*x-1\n\nz=x-0.5\n\nu=-3*x+2\n\np1&lt;-ggplot()+\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0)+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0)+\n  geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y),size=3,color=\"black\")+\n  geom_line(aes(x=x,y=y),size=2,color=\"black\")+\n  theme_bw()+\n  theme(axis.line = element_blank())+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-5,15,2))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(-5,5,by=1))+\n  labs(x=\"\",y=\"\")\n\np2&lt;-ggplot()+\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0)+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0)+\n  geom_point(aes(x=x,y=w),size=3,color=\"blue\")+\n  geom_line(aes(x=x,y=w),size=2,color=\"blue\")+\n  theme_bw()+\n  theme(axis.line = element_blank())+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-3,3,1))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(-5,5,by=1))+\n  labs(x=\"\",y=\"\")\n\np3&lt;-ggplot()+\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0)+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0)+\n  geom_point(aes(x=x,y=z),size=3,color=\"red\")+\n  geom_line(aes(x=x,y=z),size=2,color=\"red\")+\n  theme_bw()+\n  theme(axis.line = element_blank())+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-5,5,1))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(-5,5,by=1))+\n  labs(x=\"\",y=\"\")\n\np4&lt;-ggplot()+\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0)+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0)+\n  geom_point(aes(x=x,y=u),size=3,color=\"darkgreen\")+\n  geom_line(aes(x=x,y=u),size=2,color=\"darkgreen\")+\n  theme_bw()+\n  theme(axis.line = element_blank())+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-15,15,2))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(-5,5,by=1))+\n  labs(x=\"\",y=\"\")\n\ncowplot::plot_grid(p1,p2,p3,p4,labels=c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\",\"D\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n The slope for graph A is 2 with a \\(y\\)-intercept of 5. \n The slope for graph B is 1/3 with a \\(y\\)-intercept of -1 \n The for graph C is 1 with a \\(y\\)-intercept of -0.5 \n The slope for graph D is -3 with a \\(y\\)-intercept of 2 \n\nThe growth of sharks can be modeled using von Bertalanffy curves.

From 20 to 30?\n\n The average slope from ages 0 to 8 can be calcualted by: \\[ slope = \\frac{155-40}{8-0} = 14.375\\] \n The average slope from ages 0 to 8 can be calcualted by: \\[ slope = \\frac{210-200}{30-20} =1 \\] \n This tells us that the average rate of change for sharks between the ages of 0 to 8 was 14.375. For the ages, 20 to 30 the average change was 1. \n\nWhat are the units of the average slopes and why would they change for a shark as they get older?\n\n Slopes are in units of length over age, so the slope indicates the growth in centimeters every year. As animals get older, ther slow down their growth. Less energy is spent in growing and more invested in reproductive energy. \n\nHow would you find the instantaneous slope for a shark at age 12? What is the closest approximation you can make with this data and graph?\n\n We would need to apply calculus to find the true answer, but we can approximate it reasonably well by finding the smallest possible difference between two points around age 12. In this case we can use \\(\\frac{175-172}{13-12}\\) to get an approximate instaneous rate of growth of 3 cm per year.\n\n\n\nPicture of a scalloped hammerhead shark."

    "text": "Applications\n\n\n\nLet’s solve the canonical Gordon-Schaefer fisheries production model. This model formed the basis of fisheries management for half a century and is still a widely used model. It starts by defining the change in the abundance or biomass of fish by the logistic growth equation:\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{dB}{dt}=rB(t)(1-\\frac{B(t)}{K})\n\\end{equation}\\]\nwhere \\(B\\) is biomass, \\(t\\) is time, \\(r\\) is the intrinsic growth rate, and \\(K\\) is the carrying capacity.\nNext, fishers catch fish based on their effort \\(E\\) (constant), technological ability \\(q\\) (constant as well and also called the catchability coefficient), and the amount of fish \\(B\\). For simplicity, we use an easy multiplicative form:\n\\[\nY(t)=qEB(t)\n\\]\nThis catch rate takes away from the growth of the fish stock, thus we can subtract it from the logistic growth equation 1.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{dB}{dt}=rB(t)(1-\\frac{B(t)}{K})-Y(t)\n\\end{equation}\\]\na) Fishery managers are interested in finding the equilibrium level of biomass and catch. We can set \\(\\frac{dB}{dt}=0\\). Solve for the equilibrium biomass in terms of K,q,r,E.\nb) Substitute the equilibrium biomass you found in A into the catch equation.\nc) What effort leads to a maximum sustainable yield? Maximize the equation from b) with respect to effort \\(E\\).\nd) Interpret what you found in c). What are the two variables that drive fisher harvest levels?\ne) Calculate what the maximum sustainable catch is by substituting the optimal harvest level into the harvest equation."
