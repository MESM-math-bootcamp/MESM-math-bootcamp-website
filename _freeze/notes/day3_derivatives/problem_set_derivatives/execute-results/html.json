This model formed the basis of fisheries management for half a century and is still a widely used model. It starts by defining the change in the abundance or biomass of fish by the logistic growth equation:\n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{dB}{dt}=rB(t)(1-\\frac{B(t)}{K})\n\\end{equation}\n\nwhere $B$ is biomass, $t$ is time, $r$ is the intrinsic growth rate, and $K$ is the carrying capacity. \n\nNext, fishers catch fish based on their effort $E$ (constant), technological ability $q$ (constant as well and also called the catchability coefficient), and the amount of fish $B$. For simplicity, we use an easy multiplicative form:\n\n$$\nY(t)=qEB(t)\n$$\n\nThis catch rate takes away from the growth of the fish stock, thus we can subtract it from the logistic growth equation 1. \n\n\\begin{equation}\n\\frac{dB}{dt}=rB(t)(1-\\frac{B(t)}{K})-Y(t)\n\\end{equation}\n\n**a)** Fishery managers are interested in finding the equilibrium level of biomass and catch. We can set $\\frac{dB}{dt}=0$. Solve for the equilibrium biomass in terms of K,q,r,E.\n\n**b)** Substitute the equilibrium biomass you found in A into the catch equation. \n\n**c)** What effort leads to a maximum sustainable yield? Maximize the equation from b) with respect to effort $E$.\n\n**d)** Interpret what you found in c). What are the two variables that drive fisher harvest levels?\n\n**e)** Calculate what the maximum sustainable catch is by substituting the optimal harvest level into the harvest equation.",
