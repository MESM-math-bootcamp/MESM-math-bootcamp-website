Attempt exercises on your own first to make sure you fully understand the concepts. Feel free to work with anyone in the cohort after giving the problems a try!*\n\n# Algebra basics\n\n1) Describe how solving for the roots of equations (the values of $x$ for which a function $f(x)$ satisfies $f(x)=0$) could be useful in environmental science. List at least one method to find roots of a certain kind of funciton.\n\n2) Expand these equations\n\n    a) $(x+2)(3x-4)$\n\n    b) $(x^2-2y)(x+y^3)$\n\n3) Solve for $x$ in the following equations:\n\n    a) $2x-4=3x+12$\n\n    b) $-6ax+2b=x-5c$\n\n    c) $2x^2+3x-4=0$\n    \n    d) $x^2-2x-5=0$\n    \n\n# Story Problems\n\n4) Representative Concentration Pathwys (RCP) are climate chabge scenarios that project future greenhouse gas concentrations. \nA new [RCP 4.5 projection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representative_Concentration_Pathway) indicates that carbon emissions in the atmosphere will plateau at around 600 ppm. Today's atmospheric carbon concentration sits at 416 ppm. \n\n    a) If the United States continues to emit proportionally the same amount of carbon (14%), how much carbon will the US emit in 2100 under RCP 4.5? Use the conversion 1ppm=2.13 gigatons.\n\n    b) Let's say the US decides to pursue an ambitious policy to extract their contribution of carbon from the air. Climatologists model that this policy would have a trajectory of $f(c)=\\frac{-1}{8}t^2+6t+123.83$ where $t$ is each year and $c$ is the amount of carbon released by the US. When will the United States eliminate their carbon footprint?\n\n\n# Graphs\n\n6) Find the slope and $y$-intercept of the following lines. \n\n<!-- TODO: this needs to be expanded into finidng the equation of the lines-->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code  code-fold=\"true\" code-summary=\"Show the code\"}\nx=seq(-5,5)\n\ny=2*x+5\n\nw=(1/3)*x-1\n\nz=x-0.5\n\nu=-3*x+2\n\np1<-ggplot()+\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0)+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0)+\n  geom_point(aes(x=x,y=y),size=3,color=\"black\")+\n  geom_line(aes(x=x,y=y),size=2,color=\"black\")+\n  theme_bw()+\n  theme(axis.line = element_blank())+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-5,15,2))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(-5,5,by=1))+\n  labs(x=\"\",y=\"\")\n\np2<-ggplot()+\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0)+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0)+\n  geom_point(aes(x=x,y=w),size=3,color=\"blue\")+\n  geom_line(aes(x=x,y=w),size=2,color=\"blue\")+\n  theme_bw()+\n  theme(axis.line = element_blank())+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-3,3,1))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(-5,5,by=1))+\n  labs(x=\"\",y=\"\")\n\np3<-ggplot()+\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0)+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0)+\n  geom_point(aes(x=x,y=z),size=3,color=\"red\")+\n  geom_line(aes(x=x,y=z),size=2,color=\"red\")+\n  theme_bw()+\n  theme(axis.line = element_blank())+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-5,5,1))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(-5,5,by=1))+\n  labs(x=\"\",y=\"\")\n\np4<-ggplot()+\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0)+\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0)+\n  geom_point(aes(x=x,y=u),size=3,color=\"darkgreen\")+\n  geom_line(aes(x=x,y=u),size=2,color=\"darkgreen\")+\n  theme_bw()+\n  theme(axis.line = element_blank())+\n  scale_y_continuous(breaks=seq(-15,15,2))+\n  scale_x_continuous(breaks=seq(-5,5,by=1))+\n  labs(x=\"\",y=\"\")\n\ncowplot::plot_grid(p1,p2,p3,p4,labels=c(\"A\",\"B\",\"C\",\"D\"))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](problem_set_algebra_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n7) The growth of sharks can be modeled using [von Bertalanffy curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Von_Bertalanffy_function).
