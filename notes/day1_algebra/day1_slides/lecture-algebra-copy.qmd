[Workshop Objectives]{.slide-title}

<hr>

![](images/confused.gif){fig-align="center"}

1.  Shake off the math/schoolwork dust

2.  Equip students with the math skills to succeed in all Bren Courses

3.  Learn how valuable math is to environmental science

4.  Build collaborative environment, crucial for success at Bren


## {#tbl data-menu-title="Team Based Learning"}

[We will be using team based learning]{.slide-title}

<hr>

-   Science and policy are done collaboratively

-   TBL shows better learning outcomes than traditional lecturing

    -   [Higher engagement](https://www.lifescied.org/doi/pdf/10.1187/cbe.17-03-0055)

-   We'll be doing a TBL Lite\*, because I know orientation week is busy and school hasn't officially started

    -   Keep extra pre-class work and assessments to a minimum

Basically I'm using a constrained k-means algorithm to group everyone into equally balanced groups then pulling randomly from each to create balanced groups based on the likert scale responses of the survey. Full explanation will be included in a write up to see how code works

Math is a language

Policy people need to know how to support their arguments

Math helps identify weakness in models, methods, and interpretation of results

1.  Never change an equation, we rewrite into more useful forms

2.  Manipulate BOTH sides of an equation with the SAME THING

3.  Order of Operations (aka PEDMAS)
